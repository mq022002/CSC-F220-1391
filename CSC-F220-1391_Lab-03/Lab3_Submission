//EX8.1

-- int primes = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11};
Invalid because the brackets are missing.

-- float elapsedTime[] = (11.47, 12.04, 11.72, 13.86);
Valid because this is correct Java syntax.

-- int[] scores = int[30];
Invalid because it is missing "new" before "int[30]".

-- int[] primes = new (2,3,5,7,11);
Invalid because when using an initializer list, "new" is
not necessary.

-- int[] scores = new int[30];
Valid because this is correct Java syntax.

-- char grades[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f'};
Valid because this is correct Java syntax.

-- char[] grades = new char[];
Invalid because the side of the array is not defined when
the array is instantiated. Defining a size in
"new char[SIZE]" by changing "SIZE" would fix this.

//EX8.4
The problem(s) that occur with the following code is
due to its failure to print the 0th term and the 11th term
of the array. To fix this, you must initialize the count at
0 instead of 1.

public float sumArray(float[] values)
{
	float sum = 0
	for (int n=0; n<values.length; n++)
		sum += value[n];
